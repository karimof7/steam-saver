## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter a Steam **AppID** or full **Store URL** (each on a new line).  
   Example:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/
2. Click **“Check”**.
3. The app sends a request to  
`https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?...`
4. It returns price info — if the game is **free** or **very cheap**, it will be highlighted 🔥
